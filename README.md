## Description :
* This exercice is the second snippt of the class. The snippet contains string method and a binary operator.


## Main learning objective

       // (String, "see")
      .CharAt(2)
      // (String, "s")  
      // (String,"a string")
    ```

## Review : 

* Things I struggled with : the sneaky teacher put a second (misleading) argument in the string method which does nothing but confuse.
* Things you learned : CharAt method only select a character and a given index of the string.
* vocab : unary VS binary
* next step : making an exercice of it
